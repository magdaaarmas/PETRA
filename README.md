# Interrogating the Effect of Non-Coding Variants with PETRA

This repository contains the code accompanying **Armas Reyes et al. (2025)** for scoring non-coding variants with **PETRA** and performing downstream statistical analyses.  

## From fastq files to PETRA scores
The repository is organized by library type such that each directory contains all the necessary codes and supplementary files to obtain PETRA scores from fastq files. Each directory contains:

The bash scripts to perform the analysis. 

A `Python_scripts/` directory with the dependent python scripts. 

An `Example_files/` directory with examples of all the input files required to run the analysis.

A README file with explanation on how to run the analysis. 

## Plotting figures from PETRA scores
The `Figures/` directory contains the codes to reproduce the figures from Armas Reyes et al (2025) from PETRA scores. 

The figures are generated from the data contained in `Figures/data`, which contains the PETRA scores as generated by the relevant analysis codes described above.
