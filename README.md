# Interrogating the Effect of Non-Coding Variants with PETRA

This repository contains the code accompanying **Armas et al. (2025)** for scoring non-coding variants with **PETRA** and performing downstream statistical analyses.  

## Overview
The repository is organized by library type. Each directory contains:
- All scripts required to process data, from raw `.fastq` files through to PETRA expression scores.  
- Tools for downstream exploration of variant features.  
- A dedicated `README.md` within each directory explaining how to reproduce the analyses.  

An `Example/` directory is also included for each library. It provides sample input files illustrating the required formats (e.g. `file_locations.csv`, `coding_strand_info.csv`, `5UTR_information.csv`, etc.).
